The bonnevillamides represent a new class of linear peptides featuring unprecedented non-proteinogenic amino acids. All three peptides contain the newly characterized bonnevillic acid moiety (3-(3,5-dichloro-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-hydroxyacrylic acid), as well as a heavily modified proline residue. Moreover, in bonnevillamide A, the terminal proline residue found in bonnevillamides B and C is replaced with 4-methyl-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester. The structures of the three heptapeptides were elucidated by NMR, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (HRESIMS), and LC-MS/MS, and the absolute configuration of all proteinogenic amino acid residues were determined by advanced Marfey's method. Bonnevillamides A, B and C were evaluated for their effects on zebrafish embryo development. All three heptapeptides were shown to modulate heart growth and cardiac function, with bonnevillamide B having the most pronounced effect.\",\n",

HRQOL was evaluated using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory SF15 (PedsQL; children) and Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI; parent proxy) before and after a 3-month stationary cycling intervention. Sixty-two children (29 male, 33 female; mean age 11y; range 7-18y) with spastic diplegic CP, classified as levels I to III on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, were enrolled. Paired and independent t-tests were used to evaluate within- and between-group differences respectively.RESULTS: Between-group differences, favoring the cycling group, were found for PedsQL emotional functioning (p=0.046) and Parental PODCI treatment expectations scores (p=0.006). Between-group differences were not found for other scales. Within-group improvements were found in the cycling group: PedsQL total score (+5.8; p=0.006), psychosocial health summary (+6.9; p=0.008), and school functioning (+8.0; p=0.038). PODCI satisfaction with symptoms decreased significantly only in the control group (-12.0; p=0.046).INTERPRETATION: A beneficial influence of exercise on pediatric emotional well-being and parental treatment expectations was found. The evidence was not strong for other aspects of HRQOL. Results support the positive relationship between physical fitness and emotional well-being in the general population. A child's perception is important when examining change in his or her emotional well-being due to intervention.\",\n",

Occurrence of the malignant disease typically carries an average survival rate of 9-12 monthsMETHODS: : Thirteen patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical pleurectomy decortication, followed by radiotherapy from August 2012 to September 2013. Patients were followed up with computed tomography of the chest and the abdomen every 3 months. All patients were followed up until February 2014.RESULTS: In January 2014, 11 patients were still alive with a median survival of 11 months, eight patients developed a recurrence and two patients died at 8 and 9 months after surgery. After 1 year from macroscopic radical pleurectomy decortication, a 68-year-old man suffered from gingival mass turned out to be a metastatic deposit of biphasic malignant mesothelioma as first sign of multiorgan recurrence. The patient underwent chemotherapy and local radiotherapy in the oral cavity.CONCLUSIONS: This case points out the relevance of biopsy to all new growing lesions, even in uncommon anatomical sites, whenever a history of mesothelioma is on record.\",\n",

In a third patient, an apical dental infection was associated with fistulated osteomyelitis. Histology of the three sequestra showed an intraosseous squamous proliferation. It was characterized by a peripheral involvement of medullary spaces, the more mature epithelial layer covering the bone trabeculae without intervening stroma, and the basal type epithelial layer surrounding a central fibrovascular core. There were no histological or cytological signs of malignancy.CONCLUSION: PH shows an inverted pattern when compared with the centro-medullary tumoural islands seen in the various oral or odontogenic squamous neoplasms which occur in the jaws. The lack of signs of malignancy distinguish PH from common squamous cell carcinomas. A short clinical course is an important feature in the distinction of PH from the well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas which may develop in fistulated chronic osteomyelitis.\",\n",

The most frequent clinical presentation includes fever, weight loss, nasal obstruction, epistaxis, nasal or facial edema, as well as necrotic ulcers in the nasal cavity, gums, and palate. It has been found to have an important association with the Epstein-Barr virus. Diagnostic pathology could be difficult due to the typical widespread tissue necrosis. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old Caucasian male sought medical attention with a chief complaint of nasal obstruction for the past 3 years, which only responded partially to unspecific treatment. He also presented with intermittent fever and nocturnal hyperhidrosis. Physical examination with rhinoscopy demonstrated a deviated septum, congestive turbines, and fragile and pale mucous membrane with yellowish, thick mucus. The pathology report described an angiocentric centrofacial lymphoma and a positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus. CONCLUSIONS The objective of this case report was to show that this illness represents a diagnostic challenge for the treating physician. It may be concluded that despite the poor prognosis of the disease, this particular case showed slower evolution and the patient remained stable despite multiple consecutive complications.\",\n",

The neoplasms were characterized histologically by elongated or rounded cells associated with an abundant connective tissue stroma. Occasional areas of bone formation and apparent osteoid metaplasia were seen. Bone tumors appeared to arise from periosteal cells, to grow by expansion, and to invade locally, but they failed to metastasize. Neoplasms of the diaphragm originated in the central aponeurosis and appeared histologically similar to bone neoplasms. Histochemical studies demonstrated abundant alkaline phosphatase in tumor cells, and ultrastructural observations revealed subcellular characteristics of osteoblasts and chondroblasts. Tumors were readily transplantable and had histopathological characteristics similar to those of the primary viral-induced tumors. The results of this study indicate that the FBJ virus induces in NIH Swiss mice a unique type of chondroosseous neoplasm derived from periosteal cells which has a resemblance to human juxtacortical (parosteal) osteosarcoma.\",\n",

Elderly patients are considered higher risk for these radical operations and are commonly not offered surgical treatment. We reviewed our experience with extended pleurectomy and decortication among patients 70 years or older and compared them with a cohort of younger patients undergoing extended pleurectomy and decortication for malignant pleural mesothelioma.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 117 consecutive patients undergoing extended pleurectomy and decortication at a university hospital from January 2008 to December 2013. Patients 70 years and older were compared with younger patients for postoperative outcome and survival. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were 70 years or older; 63 were younger than 70 years. Older patients had more hypertension (71.2% versus 45.2%; p = 0.004) and coronary artery disease (22.6% versus 6.5%; p = 0.006). Major complications occurred in 3 patients (5.5%) in the older group and in 7 patients (11.1%) of the younger group (not significant). There were 2 deaths in each group after surgery (3.7% older versus 3.2% younger; not significant). Median survival was 15.6 months in the older patients and 14.0 months in the younger patients (not significant). Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on age groups were not significantly different with 1- and 2-year survivals of 64% versus 55% and 29% versus 32%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that whereas age may be associated with more comorbid conditions in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma undergoing extended pleurectomy and decortication, this does not necessarily translate into increased operative morbidity or mortality or shorter long-term survival.\",\n",

A clinicoradiologic diagnosis of ILD was made in all cases, and wedge biopsies were performed. Histologic evaluation revealed a neoplastic proliferation of bland epithelioid or spindled cells, showing various growth patterns simulating silicotic nodules, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Some areas mimicked adenocarcinoma, with lepidic, acinar, micropapillary, and solid patterns. Initial diagnoses by referring pathologists included reactive changes (1), hypersensitivity pneumonitis versus drug reaction (1), desquamative interstitial pneumonia versus neoplasm (1), and mesothelioma (2).

      "Abstract: A gingival tumor that invaded the anterior maxilla was removed from a 14-year-old boy and studied by light and electron microscopy. The tumor was composed exclusively of myoepithelial cells and appeared to be malignant. By light microscopy, the tumor appeared to be a poorly differentiated epithelial neoplasm of undetermined origin; however, electron microscopical examination showed myoepithelial differentiation, indicative of a salivary gland origin. To our knowledge, the present case represents the only confirmed myoepithelioma that shows features indicative of malignant potential. Myoepitheliomas may be related to mixed tumors of salivary glands.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Oral cavity cancer is frequent. Prognosis of this cancer is closely linked to the development. Although the oral cavity is a potentially accessible site for examination, up to 50% of oral cancers are not detected until the disease is well advanced.PATIENTS AND METHOD: In a region where incidence rate is particularly high, local teams involved in screening, in epidemiological survey, in diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer performed a pilot feasibility study to improve strategy of early detection of oral cancer and premalignant lesion. Tobacco venders were solicited to distribute a flyer, which invite smokers to a free examination by general practitioner. General practitioners were invited to examine smokers, and to fill a predeterminate systematic oral cavity examination record during 3 months. They were asked to refer to a specialist if there was a potentially malignant disorder.RESULTS: The involvement of tobacco venders was rated as 67.3%. Ninety-three patients were included in 3 months. General practitioners referred 27% of the examinated patients. Among them, only 63.6% really saw a specialist, and a premalignant lesion was confirmed in 15.3%; further exams were carried out in 28.6%; a benign lesion was diagnosed in 57.1%.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Original incentives for oral cavity screening were performed, based on multidisciplinary network. Nevertheless, it remains hardship to reach the targeted population and to maintain the patients in health system.\n",

      "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Increased cytoplasmic HuR expression has been noted in several cancer types, where it may contribute to the increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression observed during tumorigenesis and metastasis.METHODS: To assess the correlation between COX-2 and HuR in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the expression patterns of HuR and COX-2 were assessed via immunohistochemistry analyses of 103 OSCC samples.RESULTS: Cytoplasmic HuR expression was significantly associated with COX-2 expression (p < .025) and lymph node metastasis (p < .050) and distant metastasis (p < .025). In multivariate analysis, cytoplasmic HuR expression was identified as an independent prognostic parameter for reduced overall survival. The inhibition of HuR expression by siRNA or leptomycin B (LMB) caused a reduction in the inducibility of COX-2 in oral cancer cells.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cytoplasmic expression of HuR is associated with COX-2 expression in OSCCs and HuR can regulate COX-2 expression in oral cancer cell lines.\n",

      "Title: CT scan cerebral hemispheric asymmetries: predictors of recovery from aphasia.\n",
      "Abstract: Individual variations in anatomic cerebral asymmetries have been linked with specific neurodevelopmental processes, with patterns of cognitive ability, and with recovery from focal brain damage. The present study investigated relationships between cerebral asymmetries and recovery from aphasia. Aphasic patients (N = 25) were assessed for language recovery for 1 year poststroke, and linear measurements of cerebral asymmetries were performed on CT scans. Increasing left occipital width asymmetry was associated with faster rate of language recovery and with higher final language scores during the first year poststroke. There was, moreover, a tendency for increasing left occipital width asymmetry to be associated with less initial impairment. It is hypothesized that those aspects of neural organization conferring better premorbid language skills are the same factors conferring greater recovery of language skills and that occipital width asymmetry serves as a marker for such individual differences in neural organization.\n",

      "Title: Myoepithelioma of minor salivary gland origin. Light and electron microscopical study. Abstract: A gingival tumor that invaded the anterior maxilla was removed from a 14-year-old boy and studied by light and electron microscopy. The tumor was composed exclusively of myoepithelial cells and appeared to be malignant. By light microscopy, the tumor appeared to be a poorly differentiated epithelial neoplasm of undetermined origin; however, electron microscopical examination showed myoepithelial differentiation, indicative of a salivary gland origin. To our knowledge, the present case represents the only confirmed myoepithelioma that shows features indicative of malignant potential. Myoepitheliomas may be related to mixed tumors of salivary glands.Title: [Feasability study of screening for malignant lesions in the oral cavity targeting tobacco users]. Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Oral cavity cancer is frequent. Prognosis of this cancer is closely linked to the development. Although the oral cavity is a potentially accessible site for examination, up to 50% of oral cancers are not detected until the disease is well advanced.PATIENTS AND METHOD: In a region where incidence rate is particularly high, local teams involved in screening, in epidemiological survey, in diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer performed a pilot feasibility study to improve strategy of early detection of oral cancer and premalignant lesion. Tobacco venders were solicited to distribute a flyer, which invite smokers to a free examination by general practitioner. General practitioners were invited to examine smokers, and to fill a predeterminate systematic oral cavity examination record during 3 months. They were asked to refer to a specialist if there was a potentially malignant disorder.RESULTS: The involvement of tobacco venders was rated as 67.3%. Ninety-three patients were included in 3 months. General practitioners referred 27% of the examinated patients. Among them, only 63.6% really saw a specialist, and a premalignant lesion was confirmed in 15.3%; further exams were carried out in 28.6%; a benign lesion was diagnosed in 57.1%.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Original incentives for oral cavity screening were performed, based on multidisciplinary network. Nevertheless, it remains hardship to reach the targeted population and to maintain the patients in health system.Title: Association between expression of embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like protein HuR and cyclooxygenase-2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Increased cytoplasmic HuR expression has been noted in several cancer types, where it may contribute to the increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression observed during tumorigenesis and metastasis.METHODS: To assess the correlation between COX-2 and HuR in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the expression patterns of HuR and COX-2 were assessed via immunohistochemistry analyses of 103 OSCC samples.RESULTS: Cytoplasmic HuR expression was significantly associated with COX-2 expression (p < .025) and lymph node metastasis (p < .050) and distant metastasis (p < .025). In multivariate analysis, cytoplasmic HuR expression was identified as an independent prognostic parameter for reduced overall survival. The inhibition of HuR expression by siRNA or leptomycin B (LMB) caused a reduction in the inducibility of COX-2 in oral cancer cells.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cytoplasmic expression of HuR is associated with COX-2 expression in OSCCs and HuR can regulate COX-2 expression in oral cancer cell lines.\n"

Occurrence of the malignant disease typically carries an average survival rate of 9-12 monthsMETHODS: : Thirteen patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical pleurectomy decortication, followed by radiotherapy from August 2012 to September 2013. Patients were followed up with computed tomography of the chest and the abdomen every 3 months. All patients were followed up until February 2014.RESULTS: In January 2014, 11 patients were still alive with a median survival of 11 months, eight patients developed a recurrence and two patients died at 8 and 9 months after surgery. After 1 year from macroscopic radical pleurectomy decortication, a 68-year-old man suffered from gingival mass turned out to be a metastatic deposit of biphasic malignant mesothelioma as first sign of multiorgan recurrence. The patient underwent chemotherapy and local radiotherapy in the oral cavity.CONCLUSIONS: This case points out the relevance of biopsy to all new growing lesions, even in uncommon anatomical sites, whenever a history of mesothelioma is on record.\",\n",

The most frequent clinical presentation includes fever, weight loss, nasal obstruction, epistaxis, nasal or facial edema, as well as necrotic ulcers in the nasal cavity, gums, and palate. It has been found to have an important association with the Epstein-Barr virus. Diagnostic pathology could be difficult due to the typical widespread tissue necrosis. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old Caucasian male sought medical attention with a chief complaint of nasal obstruction for the past 3 years, which only responded partially to unspecific treatment. He also presented with intermittent fever and nocturnal hyperhidrosis. Physical examination with rhinoscopy demonstrated a deviated septum, congestive turbines, and fragile and pale mucous membrane with yellowish, thick mucus. The pathology report described an angiocentric centrofacial lymphoma and a positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus. CONCLUSIONS The objective of this case report was to show that this illness represents a diagnostic challenge for the treating physician. It may be concluded that despite the poor prognosis of the disease, this particular case showed slower evolution and the patient remained stable despite multiple consecutive complications.\",\n",

In a third patient, an apical dental infection was associated with fistulated osteomyelitis. Histology of the three sequestra showed an intraosseous squamous proliferation. It was characterized by a peripheral involvement of medullary spaces, the more mature epithelial layer covering the bone trabeculae without intervening stroma, and the basal type epithelial layer surrounding a central fibrovascular core. There were no histological or cytological signs of malignancy.CONCLUSION: PH shows an inverted pattern when compared with the centro-medullary tumoural islands seen in the various oral or odontogenic squamous neoplasms which occur in the jaws. The lack of signs of malignancy distinguish PH from common squamous cell carcinomas. A short clinical course is an important feature in the distinction of PH from the well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas which may develop in fistulated chronic osteomyelitis.\",\n",

That region has been reported to be the origin of malignant fibrous histiocytoma in 3-10% of cases. Only one case of the tumor occurring in the pharynx has been reported. Histologically it is sometimes hard to distinguish this tumor from some sarcomas and pleomorphic carcinomas. The treatment of choice is a large surgical resection, while radiotherapy and chemotherapy are reserved for recurrences. The authors present a case of oropharyngeal malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The patient complained dysphagia and dyslalia progressively worsening in six months. Pharyngo-laryngoscopy revealed a mass of the left lateral wall of oro and hypopharynx. CT scan examination showed a capsuled mass which displaced but not involved the neck neurovascular structures; there was no evidence of linphonodal involvement. Transoral surgical excision of the mass was performed with the preservation of speech and swallowing. For more than 1 year postoperatively, there has been no evidence of the disease or metastasis.\",\n",

The mean latent period of the tumors was 71 days (26 to 145) postinjection. The frequency of occurrence of neoplasms at different sites was: diaphragm, 45%; ribs, 14%; vertebrae, 14%; femora, 9%; pelvic bones, 5%; tibiae, 4%; sternebrae, 3%; and inguinal area, 7%. The neoplasms were characterized histologically by elongated or rounded cells associated with an abundant connective tissue stroma. Occasional areas of bone formation and apparent osteoid metaplasia were seen. Bone tumors appeared to arise from periosteal cells, to grow by expansion, and to invade locally, but they failed to metastasize. Neoplasms of the diaphragm originated in the central aponeurosis and appeared histologically similar to bone neoplasms. Histochemical studies demonstrated abundant alkaline phosphatase in tumor cells, and ultrastructural observations revealed subcellular characteristics of osteoblasts and chondroblasts. Tumors were readily transplantable and had histopathological characteristics similar to those of the primary viral-induced tumors. The results of this study indicate that the FBJ virus induces in NIH Swiss mice a unique type of chondroosseous neoplasm derived from periosteal cells which has a resemblance to human juxtacortical (parosteal) osteosarcoma.\",\n",

Occurrence of the malignant disease typically carries an average survival rate of 9-12 monthsMETHODS: : Thirteen patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical pleurectomy decortication, followed by radiotherapy from August 2012 to September 2013. Patients were followed up with computed tomography of the chest and the abdomen every 3 months. All patients were followed up until February 2014.RESULTS: In January 2014, 11 patients were still alive with a median survival of 11 months, eight patients developed a recurrence and two patients died at 8 and 9 months after surgery. After 1 year from macroscopic radical pleurectomy decortication, a 68-year-old man suffered from gingival mass turned out to be a metastatic deposit of biphasic malignant mesothelioma as first sign of multiorgan recurrence. The patient underwent chemotherapy and local radiotherapy in the oral cavity.CONCLUSIONS: This case points out the relevance of biopsy to all new growing lesions, even in uncommon anatomical sites, whenever a history of mesothelioma is on record.\",\n",

Although the oral cavity is a potentially accessible site for examination, up to 50% of oral cancers are not detected until the disease is well advanced.PATIENTS AND METHOD: In a region where incidence rate is particularly high, local teams involved in screening, in epidemiological survey, in diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer performed a pilot feasibility study to improve strategy of early detection of oral cancer and premalignant lesion. Tobacco venders were solicited to distribute a flyer, which invite smokers to a free examination by general practitioner. General practitioners were invited to examine smokers, and to fill a predeterminate systematic oral cavity examination record during 3\\u00a0months. They were asked to refer to a specialist if there was a potentially malignant disorder.RESULTS: The involvement of tobacco venders was rated as 67.3%. Ninety-three patients were included in 3\\u00a0months. General practitioners referred 27% of the examinated patients. Among them, only 63.6% really saw a specialist, and a premalignant lesion was confirmed in 15.3%; further exams were carried out in 28.6%; a benign lesion was diagnosed in 57.1%.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Original incentives for oral cavity screening were performed, based on multidisciplinary network. Nevertheless, it remains hardship to reach the targeted population and to maintain the patients in health system.\",\n",

We describe an unusual presentation of mesothelioma characterized by diffuse intrapulmonary growth, with absent or inconspicuous pleural involvement, clinically simulating interstitial lung disease (ILD). We identified 5 patients (median age 56 y, all men) with diffuse intrapulmonary malignant mesothelioma in our pathology consultation practice from 2009 to 2012. Clinical history, imaging, and pathology materials were reviewed. Symptoms included chronic dyspnea (4 cases), cough (3), and acute dyspnea with bilateral pneumothorax (1). Chest imaging showed irregular opacities (5), reticulation (4), pleural effusions (2), and subpleural nodular densities (1), without radiologic evidence of pleural disease or masses. A clinicoradiologic diagnosis of ILD was made in all cases, and wedge biopsies were performed. Histologic evaluation revealed a neoplastic proliferation of bland epithelioid or spindled cells, showing various growth patterns simulating silicotic nodules, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Some areas mimicked adenocarcinoma, with lepidic, acinar, micropapillary, and solid patterns. Initial diagnoses by referring pathologists included reactive changes (1), hypersensitivity pneumonitis versus drug reaction (1), desquamative interstitial pneumonia versus neoplasm (1), and mesothelioma (2). Microscopic pleural involvement was identified in 4 cases. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the characteristic immunophenotype of mesothelioma in all cases. Median survival of 3 patients treated with chemotherapy was 28 months. Two patients received no therapy and survived 3 and 4 weeks, respectively. \\\"Diffuse intrapulmonary malignant mesothelioma\\\" is a rare variant with a distinctive presentation that clinically mimics ILD.

Routine HE staining was done for comparison. The results were processed by Chi-square tests in SPSS 10.0 soft ware.RESULTS: Fifteen of the 32 patients (46.9%) were found to have micro-metastasis in 21 of 181 mLN (11.6%) examined by immunohistochemical staining though routine histopathological examinations were negative. Of those 15 cases, micro-metastasis was detected in 9 only by IHC and in 6 both by IHC and HE stainings. The positive rate of micro-metastasis in N0, N1, and N2 stratified by routine pathology was 36.8% (7/19), 33.3% (2/6) and 85.7% (6/7), respectively (N0 vs N2, P < 0.05). When stratified according to clinical staging (cTNM), pathological staging (pTNM) and pathological staging on the basis of IHC (iTNM), the frequencies of N2 cases were 0, 18.8% and 46.9%, respectively (differences among the three groups: P < 0.01). Nine cases reported as N0(7) and N1(2) by routine histopathological examination were found to have micro-metastasis in mLN by IHC staining, therefore they were actually N2 cases.CONCLUSION: IHC staining with a monoclonal antibody specific for epithelial cells (Ber-Ep4) is more sensitive in the detection of mediastinal micro-metastais than routine HE staining. Underestimation of the extent of mLN metastasis by cTNM and/or pTNM stagings frequently exists in patients with clinically early lung cancer.\",\n",

In a third patient, an apical dental infection was associated with fistulated osteomyelitis. Histology of the three sequestra showed an intraosseous squamous proliferation. It was characterized by a peripheral involvement of medullary spaces, the more mature epithelial layer covering the bone trabeculae without intervening stroma, and the basal type epithelial layer surrounding a central fibrovascular core. There were no histological or cytological signs of malignancy.CONCLUSION: PH shows an inverted pattern when compared with the centro-medullary tumoural islands seen in the various oral or odontogenic squamous neoplasms which occur in the jaws. The lack of signs of malignancy distinguish PH from common squamous cell carcinomas. A short clinical course is an important feature in the distinction of PH from the well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas which may develop in fistulated chronic osteomyelitis.\",\n",

Patients 70 years and older were compared with younger patients for postoperative outcome and survival. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were 70 years or older; 63 were younger than 70 years. Older patients had more hypertension (71.2% versus 45.2%; p = 0.004) and coronary artery disease (22.6% versus 6.5%; p = 0.006). Major complications occurred in 3 patients (5.5%) in the older group and in 7 patients (11.1%) of the younger group (not significant). There were 2 deaths in each group after surgery (3.7% older versus 3.2% younger; not significant).

Women below the age of 50 had an unusually long survival, even after adjustment for the effects of other variables in the model. A relatively large proportion of female cases had site of disease designated as peritoneum, but site was not a significant prognostic factor. These results suggest that age, gender and stage of disease should be carefully considered in designing and analyzing clinical trials for persons with mesothelioma. Survival was shorter in the 4 SEER registries which had shipbuilding as a major industry than in the others with less potential asbestos exposure, offering weak support for the hypothesis that asbestos-exposed cases of mesothelioma have worse survival experience than other cases.\",\n",

Survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier technique. The survival rate for any individual with an isolated metastasis to the axial skeleton was 0. Three of 8 patients with melanoma metastases to the appendicular skeleton are alive at 18, 25, and 52 months after Stage IV detection. A statistically significant prolonged latency period (initial diagnosis to Stage IV) in the appendicular group compared with the axial group contributed to their significant survival rate advantage. The melanoma literature strongly supports the complete resection of soft tissue metastatic foci. These data support this concept and extend it to include isolated skeletal metastases. The mechanisms by which axial and appendicular skeletal metastases occur are significantly different.

Of the factors enumerated, deeper invasion of the submucosal layer, lymphatic-venous invasion, p53 overexpression, and decreased expression of p27 were correlated significantly with metastasis.

Analysis of these markers, together with determination of the morphologic risk factors, could complement the identification of patients with metastasis on the basis of known morphologic risk factors.

A 68-year-old female underwent colectomy for rectal carcinoma with a mass in the pancreatic tail and the liver. The patient also underwent a distal pancreatectomy and a segmental liver resection at the same time. v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) gene mutation analyses, in addition to the histopathological examinations, revealed tumors of the liver and the pancreatic tail as being metastases from the primary carcinoma. We employed a collagen gel droplet-embedded culture drug sensitivity test for both the primary lesion and the pancreatic metastasis. The sensitivity to oxaliplatin and FOLFOX (5-flurouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin) were lower in the pancreatic metastasis compared to the primary lesion.

All patients received definitive IMRT. Cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy was given to patients with stages III-IVb disease.RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 47.1 months (range 11-68 months). Median survival time was not reached. For all patients, the 4-year local control (LC), regional control (RC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) were 94.0, 95.1, 85.0, and 86.1 %, respectively. Thirty-five patients experienced locoregional failures: 18 were local only, 15 were regional only, and 2 were both local and regional. Forty-two patients developed distant metastasis. Of these, 32 patients had single organ metastasis, and 10 patients had multiple organ metastasis. The most common acute toxicities were mucositis, dermatitis, and xerostomia. Grade 0-2 mucositis, dermatitis, and xerostomia occurred in 200 patients (66.7 %), 288 patients (96.0 %), and 286 patients (95.3 %), respectively. Grade 3 mucositis, dermatitis, and xerostomia were seen in 100 patients (33.3 %), 12 patients (4.0 %), and 14 patients (4.7 %), respectively. No Grade 4 acute toxicities were observed. The most common late toxicity for 284 patients who survived for more than 2 years was xerostomia. At 3 months after treatment, 16.2 % of patients had Grade 1, 73.6 % had Grade 2, and 10.2 % had Grade 3 xerostomia. However, the severity of xerostomia decreased over time. At 24 months, only 12.3 % of patients had Grade 2 xerostomia, and none had Grade 3 or 4 xerostomia.CONCLUSIONS: IMRT for NPC patients achieved excellent long-term locoregional control (LRC) and OS, with acceptable acute and late toxicities. After the treatment, xerostomia was improved over time. Distant metastasis remained the main cause of failure. More effective systemic therapy is demanding for reducing the risk of distant metastasis.\",\n",

Two weeks after the second 254-S treatment, a chest X-ray demonstrated a more than 50% reduction in the pulmonary shadow and met the WHO criteria for a partial response. Thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia and moderate nausea were observed as adverse effects of 254-S but renal toxicity was not found. Pharmacokinetics of free platinum in this patient demonstrated biphasic decay with a peak plasma concentration of 8.09 micrograms/ml. A disease-oriented phase II study of 254-S against non-small cell lung cancer should be performed to establish the efficacy of this new platinum complex.\",\n",

Stereotactic body radiotherapy is a form of radiation treatment capable of delivering a high biologically effective dose of radiation in a highly conformal manner, with a favorable toxicity profile. Enthusiasm for oligometastasis ablation, however, should be counterbalanced against the limited supporting evidence. It remains unknown to what extent (if any) ablation influences survival or quality of life. Rising clinical equipoise necessitates the completion of randomized controlled trials to assess this, several of which are underway.

We thus sought to translate these findings into clinical evidence by examining the existence of EMT in circulating tumor cells (CTC) from patients with progressive metastatic solid tumors, with a focus on men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and women with metastatic breast cancer. We showed that the majority (> 80%) of these CTCs in patients with metastatic CRPC coexpress epithelial proteins such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), cytokeratins (CK), and E-cadherin, with mesenchymal proteins including vimentin, N-cadherin and O-cadherin, and the stem cell marker CD133.

Fractionations and total doses were divided as single fractions of 800 cGy, hypofractionated multiple fractions for a total dose of 20 Gy administered in 4-5 days, and conventional multiple fractions for a total dose of 30-40 Gy in 2-4 weeks. An evaluation of the efficacy of the different radiation treatments was performed with the use of a simplified descriptive pain scale.RESULTS: Seventy-three (70.9%) of 103 treatments were evaluables. An overall response rate of 82.2% was obtained: complete in 38.3% and partial in 43.8%, irrespective of total dose, fractionation and location of irradiated spinal metameres. The analysis of results did not show significant differences between the treatment courses.CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that radiation therapy has a major role in the management of pain control and prevention of fractures in patients with spinal metastases.

Metastasis is a complex process that relies, in part, on interactions between disseminated cancer cells and resident/infiltrating stromal cells that constitute the metastatic microenvironment. Distinct immune infiltrates can either impair the metastatic process or conversely, assist in the seeding, colonization and growth of disseminated cancer cells.METHODS: Using in vivo selection approaches, we previously isolated 4T1-derived breast cancer cells that preferentially metastasize to these organs and tissues. In this study, we examined whether the propensity of breast cancer cells to metastasize to the lung, liver or bone is associated with and dependent on distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration. Immunohistocytochemistry and immunohistofluorescence approaches were used to quantify innate immune cell infiltrates within distinct metastases and depletion of Gr1+ (Ly-6C and Ly-6G) or specifically Ly-6G+ cells was performed to functionally interrogate the role of Ly-6G+ infiltrates in promoting metastasis to these organs.RESULTS: We show that T lymphocytes (CD3+), myeloid-derived (Gr-1+) cells and neutrophils (Ly-6G+ or NE+) exhibit the most pronounced recruitment in lung and liver metastases, with markedly less recruitment within bone metastatic lesions. Interestingly, these infiltrating cell populations display different patterns of localization within soft tissue metastases. T lymphocytes and granulocytic immune infiltrates are localized around the periphery of liver metastases whereas they were dispersed throughout the lung metastases. Furthermore, Gr-1+ cell-depletion studies demonstrate that infiltrating myeloid-derived cells are essential for the formation of breast cancer liver metastases but dispensable for metastasis to the lung and bone. A specific role for the granulocytic component of the innate immune infiltrate was revealed through Ly-6G+ cell-depletion experiments, which resulted in significantly impaired formation of liver metastases. Finally, we demonstrate that the CD11b+/Ly-6G+ neutrophils that infiltrate and surround the liver metastases are polarized toward an N2 phenotype, which have previously been shown to enhance tumor growth and metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the liver-metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is heavily reliant on interactions with infiltrating Ly-6G+ cells within the liver microenvironment.\",\n",

We investigated the relationship between intratumoral pathways of clonal evolution as assessed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (51 different probes) and response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, evaluated by Dworak criteria in 45 rectal cancer tumors before (n\\u200a=\\u200a45) and after (n\\u200a=\\u200a31) treatment. Losses of chromosomes 1p (44%), 8p (53%), 17p (47%), and 18q (38%) and gains of 1q (49%) and 13q (75%) as well as amplification of 8q (38%) and 20q (47%) chromosomal regions were those specific alterations found at higher frequencies. Significant association (P\\u200a<\\u200a0.05) was found between alteration of 1p, 1q, 11p, 12p, and 17p chromosomal regions and degree of response to neoadjuvant therapy. A clear association was observed between cytogenetic profile of the ancestral tumor cell clone and response to radiochemotherapy; cases presenting with del(17p) showed a poor response to neoadjuvant treatment (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.03), whereas presence of del(1p) was more frequently observed in responder patients (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.0002).

The median duration of follow-up was 30 months. The treatment protocol for intra-arterial chemotherapy consisted of methotrexate 30 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) in 7 patients and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) in 16 patients, administered in three cycles via catheters inserted in the internal iliac arteries. Concomitantly, 41.4 Gy of radiotherapy was given to the lesser pelvis. Transurethral biopsy and urine cytology were performed after the completion of treatment; patients were followed observationally if residual tumor was absent, and underwent radical cystectomy if it was present.RESULTS: At the end of treatment, 18 patients (78%) showed a complete response (CR) and the bladder was spared in all cases. Radical cystectomy was performed for 4 non-CR cases, with the result that 2 cases had residual superficial cancer and the other 2 had muscle-invading cancer histologically. Among the patients with a CR, 2 experienced intravesical recurrence. Overall, 2 patients died of cancer, 5 died of other causes and 2 died during treatment. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 70.3% and the overall survival rate 46.4%.CONCLUSIONS: A bladder-sparing approach for the treatment of muscle-invading bladder carcinoma which utilizes combined intra-arterial chemotherapy and radiotherapy may arrest the decline in quality of life induced by urinary diversion and yield equivalent therapeutic benefit to that of radical cystectomy.\",\n",

We reviewed our experience with recurrent TBSCCs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinicopathological and therapeutic variables potentially associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were assessed in 17 TBSCC patients who died of their disease after treatment.RESULTS: TBSCC recurrences were treated with surgery in 12 cases (palliative in 11, with curative intent in 1) and palliative chemotherapy in 5; the median DFS and DSS were 6 and 16 months, respectively. The mean DFS and DSS were longer in patients who had primary lateral temporal bone resection (LTBR) rather than subtotal temporal bone resection (STBR) (p=0.0173 and p=0.03, respectively). Patients given non-surgical palliative treatment for recurrences had a longer mean DSS than those who underwent surgery (trend toward significance, p=0.09).CONCLUSIONS: Our results reflect the aggressive nature of TBSCC recurrences. Our findings seem to support the use of non-surgical treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or specialist palliative care) in patients with loco-regionally advanced recurrent TBSCC. Salvage surgery might be considered for early recurrences when radicality is still achievable. Precise guidelines for the rational follow-up of surgically-treated TBSCCs need to be shared between tertiary centers.\",\n",

The pulmonary nodule was removed and minced, and the dissociated cells obtained were transplanted subcutaneously into new mice. By repeating this process, metastatic pulmonary nodules were seen clearly to have grown in size and number by the 4th transplantation. An in vitro cell line originating in the pulmonary lesion of the 5th transplantation was designated GCH-1 (m). Pulmonary metastasis occurred in all of the mice inoculated with GCH-1 (m) grown in vitro. The doubling time of the parent line GCH-1 and its subline GCH-1 (m) was 22.6 and 36.2 hours, respectively. GCH-1 (m) cells seemed to be heterogeneous in their size and shape compared with GCH-1 cells. GCH-1 (m) secreted more hCG and beta-hCG into the culture medium than GCH-1. By the immunoperoxidase technique using poly- or monoclonal antibodies, GCH-1 (m) showed a clear positive reaction but GCH-1 was only slightly positive for hCG and beta-hCG.

The effects of various histopathologic findings on disease-free interval and survival were evaluated, including the effect of resection of central disease with and without positive nodal disease. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared with the log-rang test. Multivariate analyses using a stepwise regression model were performed.RESULTS: Compared with other histologies, adenocarcinoma was associated with a significantly shorter disease-free interval (P = .037). Among patients with parametrial involvement lymph node status did not affect disease-free interval or survival. However, when patients with positive lymph nodes were examined, the additional finding of parametrial positivity significantly worsened both disease-free interval (P = .039) and survival (P = .036). When the 19 patients with positive parametria, regardless of lymph node status, were compared with those with positive lymph nodes alone, the former group had a significantly shorter disease-free interval (P = .038). The tumor recurred in 12 of these 19 patients; all cases involved the pelvis, with a median time to recurrence of 15 months. Multivariate analysis showed that adenocarcinoma histology (P = .038) and parametrial involvement (P = .043) were independent, poor prognostic indicators for disease-free interval.CONCLUSION: Involvement of the parametria, regardless of lymph node status, and adenocarcinoma histology confer a poor prognosis in high-risk patients undergoing radical hysterectomy.

Among the 30 patients (8 RMS and 22 ES), 49 bone metastases were irradiated.RESULTS: Median biologically effective dose (BED) was 42.4\\u2009Gy (range, 34.9-59.7) for RMS and 50.7\\u2009Gy (range, 31.3-65.8) for ES. Tumor recurrence occurred in six of 49 irradiated bone metastases. Cumulative incidence of local failure at a treated metastatic site was 6.6% at 1 year and 9.0% at 3 years. Dose, fractionation, and RT technique did not impact local control at an irradiated site. The presence of >5 bone metastases was associated with worse local control at an irradiated site (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07). The 3-year EFS was 33% in RMS and 16% in ES.CONCLUSIONS: RT appears to be an effective modality of local control for bone metastases in ES and RMS. Local control at sites of metastatic bone irradiation is similar to local control at the primary site after definitive RT. Doses in the biologic range prescribed for the definitive treatment of primary disease should be used for metastatic sites of disease.\",\n",

      "Abstract: A gingival tumor that invaded the anterior maxilla was removed from a 14-year-old boy and studied by light and electron microscopy. The tumor was composed exclusively of myoepithelial cells and appeared to be malignant. By light microscopy, the tumor appeared to be a poorly differentiated epithelial neoplasm of undetermined origin; however, electron microscopical examination showed myoepithelial differentiation, indicative of a salivary gland origin. To our knowledge, the present case represents the only confirmed myoepithelioma that shows features indicative of malignant potential. Myoepitheliomas may be related to mixed tumors of salivary glands.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Oral cavity cancer is frequent. Prognosis of this cancer is closely linked to the development. Although the oral cavity is a potentially accessible site for examination, up to 50% of oral cancers are not detected until the disease is well advanced.PATIENTS AND METHOD: In a region where incidence rate is particularly high, local teams involved in screening, in epidemiological survey, in diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer performed a pilot feasibility study to improve strategy of early detection of oral cancer and premalignant lesion. Tobacco venders were solicited to distribute a flyer, which invite smokers to a free examination by general practitioner. General practitioners were invited to examine smokers, and to fill a predeterminate systematic oral cavity examination record during 3 months. They were asked to refer to a specialist if there was a potentially malignant disorder.RESULTS: The involvement of tobacco venders was rated as 67.3%. Ninety-three patients were included in 3 months. General practitioners referred 27% of the examinated patients. Among them, only 63.6% really saw a specialist, and a premalignant lesion was confirmed in 15.3%; further exams were carried out in 28.6%; a benign lesion was diagnosed in 57.1%.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Original incentives for oral cavity screening were performed, based on multidisciplinary network. Nevertheless, it remains hardship to reach the targeted population and to maintain the patients in health system.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Metastatic malignant mesothelioma to the oral cavity is extremely rare. They are more common in the jaw bones than the soft tissue. Occurrence of the malignant disease typically carries an average survival rate of 9-12 monthsMETHODS: : Thirteen patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical pleurectomy decortication, followed by radiotherapy from August 2012 to September 2013. Patients were followed up with computed tomography of the chest and the abdomen every 3 months. All patients were followed up until February 2014.RESULTS: In January 2014, 11 patients were still alive with a median survival of 11 months, eight patients developed a recurrence and two patients died at 8 and 9 months after surgery. After 1 year from macroscopic radical pleurectomy decortication, a 68-year-old man suffered from gingival mass turned out to be a metastatic deposit of biphasic malignant mesothelioma as first sign of multiorgan recurrence. The patient underwent chemotherapy and local radiotherapy in the oral cavity.CONCLUSIONS: This case points out the relevance of biopsy to all new growing lesions, even in uncommon anatomical sites, whenever a history of mesothelioma is on record.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To present and characterize CT and MR imaging findings of metastases to the parotid nodes.METHODS: CT (n = 10) and MR (n = 11) images from 14 patients with metastases to the parotid nodes were reviewed. The primary tumour sites were the ocular adnexa in five patients, facial skin in four patients, upper aerodigestive tract in four patients and thyroid gland in one patient. CT and MR images were evaluated with emphasis on the size and number of parotid tumours, their location in the parotid gland, the presence of associated clinically pathological cervical nodes or previous history of cervical node metastasis, margin characteristics and the presence of central necrosis.RESULTS: A total of 18 tumours were identified in 14 patients, with an average maximal cross-sectional diameter of 19 mm (7-44 mm). 12 patients had a single parotid tumour and 2 patients had unilateral multiple tumours; 12 tumours in 10 patients were located in the parotid tail, 6 tumours in 4 patients were located in the superficial lobe and no tumour was noted in the deep lobe. In the superficial lobe, four of six tumours were located in the pretragal area. Three of nine patients whose primary sites were the ocular adnexa or skin had associated clinically pathological cervical nodes. None of these patients had a previous history of cervical node metastasis. All five patients with other primary sites had associated pathological cervical nodes or a history of such. 11 tumours had well-defined margins and 7 tumours had ill-defined margins. Post-contrast images showed central necrosis in 2 of 11 tumours.CONCLUSIONS: Metastases to the parotid nodes tend to present as solitary parotid masses with two preferential sites.\n",

      "Abstract: A gingival tumor that invaded the anterior maxilla was removed from a 14-year-old boy and studied by light and electron microscopy. The tumor was composed exclusively of myoepithelial cells and appeared to be malignant. By light microscopy, the tumor appeared to be a poorly differentiated epithelial neoplasm of undetermined origin; however, electron microscopical examination showed myoepithelial differentiation, indicative of a salivary gland origin. To our knowledge, the present case represents the only confirmed myoepithelioma that shows features indicative of malignant potential. Myoepitheliomas may be related to mixed tumors of salivary glands.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Oral cavity cancer is frequent. Prognosis of this cancer is closely linked to the development. Although the oral cavity is a potentially accessible site for examination, up to 50% of oral cancers are not detected until the disease is well advanced.PATIENTS AND METHOD: In a region where incidence rate is particularly high, local teams involved in screening, in epidemiological survey, in diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer performed a pilot feasibility study to improve strategy of early detection of oral cancer and premalignant lesion. Tobacco venders were solicited to distribute a flyer, which invite smokers to a free examination by general practitioner. General practitioners were invited to examine smokers, and to fill a predeterminate systematic oral cavity examination record during 3 months. They were asked to refer to a specialist if there was a potentially malignant disorder.RESULTS: The involvement of tobacco venders was rated as 67.3%. Ninety-three patients were included in 3 months. General practitioners referred 27% of the examinated patients. Among them, only 63.6% really saw a specialist, and a premalignant lesion was confirmed in 15.3%; further exams were carried out in 28.6%; a benign lesion was diagnosed in 57.1%.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Original incentives for oral cavity screening were performed, based on multidisciplinary network. Nevertheless, it remains hardship to reach the targeted population and to maintain the patients in health system.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Metastatic malignant mesothelioma to the oral cavity is extremely rare. They are more common in the jaw bones than the soft tissue. Occurrence of the malignant disease typically carries an average survival rate of 9-12 monthsMETHODS: : Thirteen patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical pleurectomy decortication, followed by radiotherapy from August 2012 to September 2013. Patients were followed up with computed tomography of the chest and the abdomen every 3 months. All patients were followed up until February 2014.RESULTS: In January 2014, 11 patients were still alive with a median survival of 11 months, eight patients developed a recurrence and two patients died at 8 and 9 months after surgery. After 1 year from macroscopic radical pleurectomy decortication, a 68-year-old man suffered from gingival mass turned out to be a metastatic deposit of biphasic malignant mesothelioma as first sign of multiorgan recurrence. The patient underwent chemotherapy and local radiotherapy in the oral cavity.CONCLUSIONS: This case points out the relevance of biopsy to all new growing lesions, even in uncommon anatomical sites, whenever a history of mesothelioma is on record.\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To present and characterize CT and MR imaging findings of metastases to the parotid nodes.METHODS: CT (n = 10) and MR (n = 11) images from 14 patients with metastases to the parotid nodes were reviewed. The primary tumour sites were the ocular adnexa in five patients, facial skin in four patients, upper aerodigestive tract in four patients and thyroid gland in one patient. CT and MR images were evaluated with emphasis on the size and number of parotid tumours, their location in the parotid gland, the presence of associated clinically pathological cervical nodes or previous history of cervical node metastasis, margin characteristics and the presence of central necrosis.RESULTS: A total of 18 tumours were identified in 14 patients, with an average maximal cross-sectional diameter of 19 mm (7-44 mm). 12 patients had a single parotid tumour and 2 patients had unilateral multiple tumours; 12 tumours in 10 patients were located in the parotid tail, 6 tumours in 4 patients were located in the superficial lobe and no tumour was noted in the deep lobe. In the superficial lobe, four of six tumours were located in the pretragal area. Three of nine patients whose primary sites were the ocular adnexa or skin had associated clinically pathological cervical nodes. None of these patients had a previous history of cervical node metastasis. All five patients with other primary sites had associated pathological cervical nodes or a history of such. 11 tumours had well-defined margins and 7 tumours had ill-defined margins. Post-contrast images showed central necrosis in 2 of 11 tumours.CONCLUSIONS: Metastases to the parotid nodes tend to present as solitary parotid masses with two preferential sites.\n",

      "Abstract: Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to locally advanced rectal carcinoma patients has proven efficient in a high percentage of cases. Despite this, some patients show nonresponse or even disease progression. Recent studies suggest that different genetic alterations may be associated with sensitivity versus resistance of rectal cancer tumor cells to neoadjuvant therapy. We investigated the relationship between intratumoral pathways of clonal evolution as assessed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (51 different probes) and response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, evaluated by Dworak criteria in 45 rectal cancer tumors before (n = 45) and after (n = 31) treatment. Losses of chromosomes 1p (44%), 8p (53%), 17p (47%), and 18q (38%) and gains of 1q (49%) and 13q (75%) as well as amplification of 8q (38%) and 20q (47%) chromosomal regions were those specific alterations found at higher frequencies. Significant association (P < 0.05) was found between alteration of 1p, 1q, 11p, 12p, and 17p chromosomal regions and degree of response to neoadjuvant therapy. A clear association was observed between cytogenetic profile of the ancestral tumor cell clone and response to radiochemotherapy; cases presenting with del(17p) showed a poor response to neoadjuvant treatment (P = 0.03), whereas presence of del(1p) was more frequently observed in responder patients (P = 0.0002). Moreover, a significantly higher number of copies of chromosomes 8q (P = 0.004), 13q (P = 0.003), and 20q (P = 0.002) were found after therapy versus paired pretreatment rectal cancer samples. Our results point out the existence of an association between tumor cytogenetics and response to neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. Further studies in larger series of patients are necessary to confirm our results.\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate long-term outcome in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.METHODS: Between January 2006 and August 2008, 300 patients with histologically proven NPC were enrolled in this multicenter prospective study. All patients received definitive IMRT. Cisplatin-based concurrent chemotherapy was given to patients with stages III-IVb disease.RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 47.1 months (range 11-68 months). Median survival time was not reached. For all patients, the 4-year local control (LC), regional control (RC), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) were 94.0, 95.1, 85.0, and 86.1 %, respectively. Thirty-five patients experienced locoregional failures: 18 were local only, 15 were regional only, and 2 were both local and regional. Forty-two patients developed distant metastasis. Of these, 32 patients had single organ metastasis, and 10 patients had multiple organ metastasis. The most common acute toxicities were mucositis, dermatitis, and xerostomia. Grade 0-2 mucositis, dermatitis, and xerostomia occurred in 200 patients (66.7 %), 288 patients (96.0 %), and 286 patients (95.3 %), respectively. Grade 3 mucositis, dermatitis, and xerostomia were seen in 100 patients (33.3 %), 12 patients (4.0 %), and 14 patients (4.7 %), respectively. No Grade 4 acute toxicities were observed. The most common late toxicity for 284 patients who survived for more than 2 years was xerostomia. At 3 months after treatment, 16.2 % of patients had Grade 1, 73.6 % had Grade 2, and 10.2 % had Grade 3 xerostomia. However, the severity of xerostomia decreased over time. At 24 months, only 12.3 % of patients had Grade 2 xerostomia, and none had Grade 3 or 4 xerostomia.CONCLUSIONS: IMRT for NPC patients achieved excellent long-term locoregional control (LRC) and OS, with acceptable acute and late toxicities. After the treatment, xerostomia was improved over time. Distant metastasis remained the main cause of failure. More effective systemic therapy is demanding for reducing the risk of distant metastasis.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Oral cavity cancer is frequent. Prognosis of this cancer is closely linked to the development. Although the oral cavity is a potentially accessible site for examination, up to 50% of oral cancers are not detected until the disease is well advanced.PATIENTS AND METHOD: In a region where incidence rate is particularly high, local teams involved in screening, in epidemiological survey, in diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer performed a pilot feasibility study to improve strategy of early detection of oral cancer and premalignant lesion. Tobacco venders were solicited to distribute a flyer, which invite smokers to a free examination by general practitioner. General practitioners were invited to examine smokers, and to fill a predeterminate systematic oral cavity examination record during 3 months. They were asked to refer to a specialist if there was a potentially malignant disorder.RESULTS: The involvement of tobacco venders was rated as 67.3%. Ninety-three patients were included in 3 months. General practitioners referred 27% of the examinated patients. Among them, only 63.6% really saw a specialist, and a premalignant lesion was confirmed in 15.3%; further exams were carried out in 28.6%; a benign lesion was diagnosed in 57.1%.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Original incentives for oral cavity screening were performed, based on multidisciplinary network. Nevertheless, it remains hardship to reach the targeted population and to maintain the patients in health system.\n",

      "Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT), an experimental cancer therapy, was studied in an animal model of chemically-induced epithelial dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma. PDT was performed 24 hours after i.v. injection of 2.5 mg/kg bw Photofrin, and using 100 J/cm2 incident light at two activation wavelengths (514.5 nm or 625 nm). Two days after PDT, the majority of rats macroscopically showed a marked erythema of the entire palatal region. Microscopically all the rats showed oedema, haemorrhage, and necrosis of the epithelium of the intermolar area. The long-term results were not so favourable. No evidence of disease was found in 6 out of 20 rats in the 514.5 nm group and in 2 out of 20 rats in the 625 nm treated group. Epithelial dysplasia was found in 14 out of 20 rats in the 514.5 nm group, and in 18 out of 20 rats of the 625 nm treated group. Squamous cell carcinomas were found in 4 out of 20 rats treated with 514.5 nm and in 7 out of 20 rats in the 625 nm treated groups. Comparing both treatment wavelengths, better results were obtained in the 514.5 nm groups as this wavelength gave less normal tissue damage. Based on the results of this study the application of PDT for the treatment of field cancerization and squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, is discussed.\n",

      "Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Metastatic malignant mesothelioma to the oral cavity is extremely rare. They are more common in the jaw bones than the soft tissue. Occurrence of the malignant disease typically carries an average survival rate of 9-12 monthsMETHODS: : Thirteen patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical pleurectomy decortication, followed by radiotherapy from August 2012 to September 2013. Patients were followed up with computed tomography of the chest and the abdomen every 3 months. All patients were followed up until February 2014.RESULTS: In January 2014, 11 patients were still alive with a median survival of 11 months, eight patients developed a recurrence and two patients died at 8 and 9 months after surgery. After 1 year from macroscopic radical pleurectomy decortication, a 68-year-old man suffered from gingival mass turned out to be a metastatic deposit of biphasic malignant mesothelioma as first sign of multiorgan recurrence. The patient underwent chemotherapy and local radiotherapy in the oral cavity.CONCLUSIONS: This case points out the relevance of biopsy to all new growing lesions, even in uncommon anatomical sites, whenever a history of mesothelioma is on record.\n",
